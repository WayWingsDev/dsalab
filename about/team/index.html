After graduating, she worked at an art gallery in Malaysia and taught English in a small village in the foothills of the Nepali Himalayas. She returned to the states with a passion for both spicy food and getting involved in the startup tech industry as a means for community development, so she became a disciple of Matz and started building with Ruby. Since then, she has worked with a variety of startups in the role of lead backend developer, consultant, and Scoville scale expert. She's beyond stoked to be part of The Iron Yard team and spread the cult (erm, I mean joy) of Ruby.</p>

              <h2>Jesse Wolgamott</h2>
              <h4>Ruby Instructor</h4>
              <p>JWo was not born in Texas, but got here as fast as he could, y’all. (born in Arizona and lived in Spain, Portugal, Egypt, Kenya, and Japan — all before he was 6), and was given access to a computer (8086) soon thereafter. After Dig-Dug, being the only kid in school typing reports and handing in his school reports in Lotus 123, he started to like these computer things. He programmed Perl during Web 1.0, .NET during the bust, and now Ruby and Javascripts. Jesse has been a consultant using open source software stack for 5 years, and is an open source developer and contributor. Jesse has taught Ruby courses since 2012, authored a book on AngularJS+Rails, and has loved Rails since 2007. Jesse has trained and spoke at conferences across the US, and has determined that Tacos rule and salads drool.</p>

              <h2>Laura Lindeman</h2>
              <h4>Teaching Assistant</h4>
              <p>Laura Lindeman is an all-around word nerd: avid reader, blogger, and occasional grammar pedant who has opinions about the Oxford comma. She comes to The Iron Yard after several years of working in the non-profit sector and is excited to translate her organizing skills into empowering the next generation of developers. Laura is a firm believer in the power of community and the ways technology brings people together, though sharing a delicious meal in person is even better. She has a soft spot for cardigans, funky earrings, and chocolate with peanut butter. When she's not writing or helping students with Ruby on Rails, you can often find her backpacking, bargain hunting, or trying out new recipes.</p>

              <h2>Joe Tamburro</h2>
              <h4>Teaching Assistant</h4>
              <p>Joe knew zero about programming before taking The Iron Yard's Front End Engineering class. Now he's a solid hacker and a gifted programming teacher. He graduated from Clemson in 2009 with a B.S. in Business Management. He spent the two years prior to enrolling in our school as a touring drummer in a band based out of Greenville, SC. He loved traveling and being on the road, but towards the end he knew it was time to close that chapter in his life. Here's what he has to say: &quot;I can say without any hesitation that going through with this course was the best decision I have ever made.&quot; We agree...so much so that we kept him around to support Mason as a Teaching Assistant.</p>
